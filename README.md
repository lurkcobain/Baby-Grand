Baby Grand is an 11u keyboard with a 9-key num/nav pad. It aims to please by offering an HHKB split-space option, as well as a WKL full-space option, and left or right orientation for it's 9-key cluster. 


Purple keys are interchangeable based on layout, meaning you can also have a WKL split-space if you don't want HHKB split or 7u WKL.
