# Baby Grand
Baby Grand is an 18u keyboard that features a pen rail extrusion with a built-in lightpipe facing the keys. The layout is an Alpha Stagger variant, flanked by a southpaw numpad and a 9key macro cluster on the right, below which sits either an OLED or slide encoder. The split-space variant is intended to be reminiscent of the foot pedals of a piano.
